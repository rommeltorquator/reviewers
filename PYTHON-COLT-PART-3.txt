ITERATORS GENERATORS


*** iterators vs iterables


- iterable = lists, strings, tuples, dictionary, sets
- iterable is capable of creating an iterator
- to be an iterable, you need to create your own iterator

dir(list) # this returns all properties and methods of an object

- every iterables have __iter__ method

- iter() and next() methods
names = ["Abby", "Mabel", "Steph"]
iter_obj = iter(names)

print(next(iter_obj))
print(next(iter_obj))
print(next(iter_obj))
